description: Flutter toolkit for Auth0 API, Using Auth0, developers can connect any application 
              written in any language or stack, and define the external identity providers, 
              as well as integrations, that they want to use. This short Auth0 product tour 
              gives an overview of this process, touching upon Auth0â€™s unmatched extensibility 
              and its applicability to B2B, B2C, and B2E use cases
